# Gaussian Variable Arithmetic
 Basic arithmetic with gaussian variables

This library is intended to be used to perform quick arithmetic on variables with gaussian (normal) uncertainty. It includes addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

However, the approximations for multiplication and division are quite amateur, and need significant refinement if you are planning to use this for anything remotely critical. I wrote this for a simple homework assignment. DO NOT USE FOR CRITICAL APPLICATIONS.
